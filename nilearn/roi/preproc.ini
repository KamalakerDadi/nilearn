# pypreprocess configuration.
#
# Copy this file to the acquisition directory containing the data you wish to
# preprocess. Then, manually edit the values to customize the pipeline to suite your
# needs.
#
# Disable a preprocessing step by setting 'disable = True' under the corresponding
# section, or simply comment the section altogether.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTES
# ===============
# - indexing begins from 1 (matlab style)
# - you can explicitly specifiy the software to be used for a specific stage of the
#   preprocessing by accordingly setting the 'software' field under the
#   corresponding section (e.g like so: software = spm)
# - A value of 'auto', 'unspecified', 'none', etc. for a parameter means it should
# be specified or inferred at run-time

        <p>
          <a href="http://cobre.mrn.org/">The Center for Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE)</a> is contributing raw anatomical and functional MR data from 72 patients with Schizophrenia and 75 healthy controls (ages ranging from 18 to 65 in each group). All subjects were screened and excluded if they had; history of neurological disorder, history of mental retardation, history of severe head trauma with more than 5 minutes loss of consciousness, history of substance abuse or dependence within the last 12 months. Diagnostic information was collected using the Structured Clinical Interview used for DSM Disorders (SCID).
        </p>
        <p>
          A multi-echo MPRAGE (MEMPR) sequence was used with the following parameters: TR/TE/TI = 2530/[1.64, 3.5, 5.36, 7.22, 9.08]/900 ms, flip angle = 7Â°, FOV = 256x256 mm, Slab thickness = 176 mm, Matrix = 256x256x176, Voxel size =1x1x1 mm, Number of echos = 5, Pixel bandwidth =650 Hz, Total scan time = 6 min. With 5 echoes, the TR, TI and time to encode partitions for the MEMPR are similar to that of a conventional MPRAGE, resulting in similar GM/WM/CSF contrast.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rest data was collected with single-shot full k-space echo-planar imaging (EPI) with ramp sampling correction using the intercomissural line (AC-PC) as a reference (TR: 2 s, TE: 29 ms, matrix size: 64x64, 32 slices, voxel size: 3x3x4 mm3).
        </p>
        <p>Slice Acquisition Order:<br>
          Rest scan - collected in the Axial plane - series ascending - multi slice mode - interleaved<br>
          MPRAGE - collected in the Sag plane - series interleaved - multi slice mode - single shot<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          The following data are released for every participant:
